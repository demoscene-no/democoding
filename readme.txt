Hi there

I have decided to release some example-sourcecode so that people wanting
to get started with democoding can get an idea about how to do so. This
is NOT very optimized code, and is written for educational purposes. More
sourcecode might follow.

The sourcecode is written in C using msvc6. The package contains a
grid-expander, some blending-routines, an imageloader, some basic
filewrappers and a ddraw-handling lib. The imageloader uses OLE to load
JPEG, GIF and BMP images.

Only one walter was harmed during the production of these sources.

The sourcecode may be freely used for non-comercial as long as you give
me credit for it.
